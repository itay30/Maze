        of how to play the game. to start solving the maze, move your finger slightly from the bottom left
        corner upwards until the vibrate stops, when you will enter the maze from the right place, you will
        hear a sound so you know you started the maze from the right place. from now on, you need to move
        your finger on the screen and start solving the maze, when your phone vibrate, it means that you
        got out of the right track, but, if you will go back to the right place of the maze, the vibrate
        will stop and you can keep solving the maze. if you failed solving the maze, or you decided to
        give up and, dont worry, you can start solving the maze again from the start, or, you can double
        tap the top of your screen and you will get a new maze. when you will finish the maze correctly,
        you will hear a sound. after that, to move on to the next maze, all you need to do is to take your
        finger off the screen and thats it. you can now start solving the next maze. good luck! have fun!
